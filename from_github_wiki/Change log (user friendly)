### 2.2 (November 2016)
##### New features

* Site notices: for making announcement to logged in users.
* [Database scripts](http://antcat.org/database_scripts): for quickly creating scripts such as for finding [valid taxa with non-valid parents](http://antcat.org/database_scripts/valid_taxa_with_non_valid_parents). It is linked from the Editor's Panel.
* User pages: clicking on an editor's name now takes you to their user page, where you can see their most recent catalog changes and most recent comments. You can visit your own user page by clicking on your name in the header.
*  [Wikipedia tools](http://antcat.org/catalog/429161/wikipedia): hidden page (it's not liked from anywhere) for Wikipedia editors. Find it by appending "/wikipedia" to any catalog page.

##### New minor features

* [Browse comments](http://antcat.org/comments): new a page for browsing all comments in chronological order. It is linked from the Editor's Panel ("see more" next to "Most recent comments").
* [Emailing users](http://antcat.org/users/emails): editor's can generate a list of all users' emails. Linked from the users page and Editor's Panel.
* [Advanced search](http://antcat.org/catalog/search): added functionality for searching for taxa described between two years.

##### Removed features

* The 'replace missing references' feature has been removed because it was broken, and quite possibly not being used.

##### Changes/fixes

* The Editor's panel now lists the most recent user activity from the feed and most recent comments.
* Tons of performance improvements. Most of these have no visible effects, but exceptions include: the main page shows less content, and catalog pages defaults to only showing statistics of valid children.
* All the redundant curly braces that you might have seen in taxt items have been removed.

---

##### Notes/Legend
* Most listed changes were made in more than one [commit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commit_(version_control)) ("individual code changes"), so it would not make sense to link all of them.
* Blue asterisk = link to the actual change ("commit") where the bulk of the code was modified, usually contains comments (in particular if a feature was removed).
* Black asterisk [after a blue one] = indicates that in addition the the linked commit, a large share of the changes to the listed item was made in at least one other commit, but it's not linked because it's not very important / lazy.
