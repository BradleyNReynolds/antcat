Feature: Expanding reference keys
  As an AntCat user
  When I see a short reference key
  I want to be able to click it and see the full reference
  So that I don't have to switch context to see the information I need

  Background:
    Given the Formicidae family exists

  Scenario: Expanding a reference key in the catalog
    # TODO
