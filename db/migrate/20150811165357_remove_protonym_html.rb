  # Name_html
  # protonym_html
  #
  # A taxon has protonym. A protonym has a name.
  # A taxon also has a name.
  #
  # In the cases we are currently examining, the name record for taxa and protonym are the same record.
  #
  #  The notion of a distinct “protonym_html” in name that can be distinct from the other fields makes little sense

  #   so I’m going to have to unwind this by making new “name” records that are distinct if they don’t already exist,
  # and pointing the protonym_name_id field to them.
