    # HACK to make this work at the same time:
    # * Highlight single activity item in context.
    # * Not showing `params[:page]` in single-activity-links.
    # * Make the delete button return to the previous page.
    # * Make will_paginate not go bananas. <-- This what makes everything hard.
